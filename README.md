 ## About Project

In this project, there is a clock, it also has a timer and alarm. The only intention of making this is that I will get to learn some skills.
 
 `What was my motivation to create this all in one clock application?`

 1. New things to learn
    - as in :- Features(new Date(),new audio(),setTimeOut,clearTimeOut ect.)
 2. How clocks work

`Why did I build this project?`

1. I had seen the UI design of a digital clock, then I thought to make it. Because :-
 - First UI is awesome,
 - There will be a lot to learn.

 `What problem does it solve?`
 1. You can see time,
 2. You can set timer,
 3. You can set alarm (In this when alarm time nerest then it will ring).

 `What did I learn from this project?`

1. JS Date object
2. Static method in Date
3. setInterval() and clearInterval() method
4. string.prototype.padStar()
5. string.prototype.padEnd()
6. JS number prototype
7. setTimeout() and clearTimeout() method
8. Object prototype toString()
9. Event prevent default
10. New Audio (for ring in alarm).

`What makes  my project stand out?`

1. Features 

(I changed the quote in this code by using 'if and else condition' according to night and morning.)

- Code ðŸ‘‡
        
        
        
        if(hour == 0){
            hour = 12;
        } if(hour > 12){
            hour = hour - 12;
            per = "PM" ;
            
        }

        if (per === 'AM'){
            quotation.innerText = " An early-morning walk is a blessing for the whole day. â€“ Henry David Thoreau"
        } else if(per === 'PM'){
            quotation.innerText = "Each night, when I go to sleep, I die. And the next morning, when I wake up, I am reborn.â€• Mahatma Gandhi"
        }

- I have used sound for alarm in this project.
